* https://github.com/sunilsoni/annotation-learning/blob/master/src/test/java/com/annotation/jackson/JsonPropertyAnnotationTest.java[@JsonProperty] The @JsonProperty annotation is used to map property names with JSON keys during serialization and deserialization. By default, if you try to serialize a POJO, the generated JSON will have keys mapped to the fields of the POJO. If you want to override this behavior, you can use the @JsonProperty annotation on the fields. It takes a String attribute that specifies the name that should be mapped to the field during serialization.

You can also use this annotation during deserialization when the property names of the JSON and the field names of the Java object do not match.
